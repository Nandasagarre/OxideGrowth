This repo explores Sio2 Oxide growth, with Deal-Grove (DG) model; 

Note: DG model is valid only at temperatures (800–1000 degree c).
For very thin oxides (<25 nm), the DG model underestimates the growth rates/ thickness;

For above 1000 degree C and less than 25 nm Oxide thickness regime Massoud Model is employed;

To access the Oxidation growth jupyter notebook  https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nandasagarre/oxidegrowth/HEAD?urlpath=tree/OxideGrowth.ipynb
Temperature can be varied via Slider to visualize the oxide thickness and oxide growth rate;

Used Python;
